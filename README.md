# SyntactikJs
This is an experiment created to prove that it is possible to convert [Syntactik parser](https://github.com/syntactik/Syntactik/blob/master/Syntactik/Parser.cs)
to another language (in this case JavaScript) in matter of days by just converting language instructions one to one. Like, for example, 
converting if statement in C# to if statement in JavaScript etc.
