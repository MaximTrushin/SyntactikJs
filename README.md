# SyntactikJs
This project is an experiment created to prove that it is possible to convert [Syntactik parser](https://github.com/syntactik/Syntactik/blob/master/Syntactik/Parser.cs)
to another language (in this case JavaScript) in a matter of days by just converting language instructions one to one. Like, for example, 
converting if statement in C# into if statement in JavaScript, etc.
Only the class Parser and all required classes are converted. Visitors, DOM classes, and compiler pipeline has not been converted.
